**BRIEF**
Use Ruby to create a terminal app that behaves like an ATM in real life.

-pin
-accounts
-language
-withdraw
-check balance
-greeting
-deposit
-fee

minimal viable product: withdraw, check balance, greeting, deposit; (pin?)

**CURRENT STATUS**
Loops functioning, as does withdraw, deposit, check balance & exiting programme.

**NEXT STEP**
Try adding a pin system to the programme (maybe using a hash to store peoples codes)

**ISSUES**
V1 uses global variables, make a V2
